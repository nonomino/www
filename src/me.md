Heyy 🖖 this is Saahil and welcome to my TED Talk!

Professionally, I'm a freshly baked software developer, just beginning to wrap my head around the intricacies of the field. My interests span backend development, Linux, programming language design, and similar areas, basically, all the stuff that sounds impressive at parties but leaves most people scratching their heads.

Unprofessionally, I’m your standard-issue nerd. I spend my free time tinkering with projects that range from “could be useful” to “why did I build this again?” I also have a habit of getting lost in fiction—often more than I intend—and dabbling in long-forgotten languages like Old Norse, because nothing says fun like reviving ancient grammar rules!
